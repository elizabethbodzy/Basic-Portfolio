            <p> Hey my name is Elizabeth Bodzy. I am a graphic designer living in Dallas, Texas. I have 
                had the experience of living in New York City as I attended graduate school at Parsons 
                School of Design. I graduated in May 2017 with a MFA in Design and Technology. I attended
                University of Arizona prior to Parsons, studying and graduating with a BFA in Visual 
                Communications - with a focus in graphic design. </p>
        
              
            <p> I am currently enrolled in a full-stack development course at SMU, and I look forward
                to learning and developing my career. I am excited to see where this course takes me, in 
                hopes of combining my design career with my development path. </p>
